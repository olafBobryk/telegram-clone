# Telegram Clone

A modern Telegram web application clone built with Next.js, TypeScript, and Zustand for state management. This project replicates the core functionality and user interface of Telegram with responsive design and real-time chat simulation.

## Averlo Stage branch

`averlo-stage-v1` preserves the upstream MIT history while providing a deterministic, network-independent Telegram conversation at `/chats/2`. The route uses checked-in fixtures and assets, with no authentication gate, timers, random events, persistence dependency, or runtime media downloads.
